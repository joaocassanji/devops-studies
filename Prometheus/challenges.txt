Prometheus Installation on Kubernetes:
Deploy a Prometheus server onto your Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
Install Prometheus without using Helm, using Kubernetes manifests and YAML files.
Verify that Prometheus is running by accessing the Prometheus web interface.
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from a sample application deployed on the same cluster.

Consulting Metrics with PromQL:
Write a PromQL query to retrieve the CPU usage metric for a specific Kubernetes pod.
Use PromQL to calculate the average response time over a certain time range for an HTTP request metric.
Create a PromQL query that counts the number of HTTP requests with a response status of 500.
Fetch the memory utilization metric for all pods in a particular namespace using PromQL.
Construct a PromQL query that calculates the 95th percentile latency of a given HTTP request metric.

Alertmanager:
Install Alertmanager onto your Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
Configure Alertmanager to receive alerts from Prometheus and send them to a Slack channel.
Set up an Alertmanager route to group and deduplicate similar alerts.
Create an alert rule in Prometheus that triggers an alert based on a specific metric threshold.
Create an Alertmanager notification template to customize alert messages sent to Slack.
