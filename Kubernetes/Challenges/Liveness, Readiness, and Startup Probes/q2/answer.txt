Test Liveness Probe:
You can do this by executing into the container of one of the Pods and causing it to become unresponsive. For example, you can use the following commands:

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

Inside the container shell, you can use a command like kill to stop a process or otherwise make the application unresponsive. 
After a few seconds, the Liveness Probe should detect this and trigger a Pod restart.



Test Readiness Probe:
To test it, you can simulate a scenario where the application is not ready to serve traffic. You can do this by modifying the application code to return a non-200 HTTP status code for the readiness check endpoint.

After applying the code change, wait for a few moments, and you should observe that the affected Pod is removed from the list of endpoints for the associated Service and, therefore, no longer receives incoming traffic.



Monitor Pod Recovery:
Kubernetes will automatically try to recover the Pods based on the probe results. You can observe that the affected Pods are terminated and replaced with new ones.
