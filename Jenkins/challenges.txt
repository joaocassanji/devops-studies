Jenkins Installation:
Set up Jenkins on a preferred environment (local or cloud-based).
Verify that Jenkins is accessible by accessing its web interface.
Install Jenkins using Docker, if you haven't done so already.
Install Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Install Plugins:
Install the "Pipeline" plugin in Jenkins to enable pipeline functionality.
Install a source code management (SCM) plugin (e.g., Git) to integrate with version control systems.
Install a Kubernetes plugin to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.

Configuring Credentials:
Create a Jenkins credential for connecting to your version control repository (e.g., GitHub).
Configure a Kubernetes credential in Jenkins to access your Kubernetes cluster.
Set up a username/password credential for authentication with an external service (e.g., Docker Hub).

Connecting to Kubernetes:
Configure Jenkins to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes plugin.
Create a pipeline that deploys a simple application to your Kubernetes cluster.

Preparing Git Repository:
Create a sample Git repository containing a simple application.
Add a Jenkinsfile to the repository that defines a basic pipeline.

Creating a Pipeline:
Create a Jenkins pipeline using the classic UI.
Implement a declarative pipeline that fetches code from a Git repository and runs a build step.
Write a scripted pipeline that performs a build and deployment based on a Jenkinsfile.

Jenkinsfile:
Write a Jenkinsfile with multiple stages, including building, testing, and deploying an application.
Utilize environment variables in a Jenkinsfile to dynamically configure pipeline behavior.
Incorporate conditional logic in a Jenkinsfile to execute different stages based on certain conditions.
